This How-To documents the process for setting up the build environment.

TODO .. in process

Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless
==========================
- Set up Raspbian for wireless ssh
- Configure wireless settings for extra security

- Install gstreamer ...
- Install ZeroMQ

Desktop (Ubuntu 18.04)
======================
- Install gstreamer dependencies
- Install OpenCV ...
- Install ZeroMQ

Setting up cross-compiling for Raspberry Pi
-------------------------------------------
Follow instructions found at https://medium.com/@au42/the-useful-raspberrypi-cross-compile-guide-ea56054de187
except using pigpio instead of wiringPi
- In a separate directory for raspberry pi workspace (e.g. ~/raspberry-pi-tools/)
    - git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools
    - git clone https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio
    - Copy the toolchain-rpi.cmake file from firmware/arc directory to the pigpio directory
    - In the pigpio directory:
        - mkdir build && cd build
        - cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain-rpi.cmake
        - make
        The above should succeed and produce the .so files in the build folder
- To compile arc:
    - cd firmware/arc
    - mkdir build && cd build
    - cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain-rpi.cmake
    - make
    The compiled object 'arc' will reside in build/src
    You should be able to just scp it over to the raspberry pi and execute it.
